                crimes against another player. This means you may not rob or kill
                anyone you are meeting for the first time. If you are being
                antagonized and have an interaction the first time you meet, you may
                commit crimes. Interaction time is voided if there is significant
                backstory to commit a crime against someone.
            </li>
            <li>
                RDM: Attacking another player/group without any story or roleplay
                leading up to it.

                the last 45 minutes and all events leading up to being downed in the
                current scenario. You may not respawn if you’ve been advised that
                police or EMS is on the way to your scene. You must try to contact
                medical help through your phone or in-character communication when

            </li>
            <li>
                If you are found on your side and calling for help on the scene, you
                may remember but may not interact with anyone around you. If you are
                found on your back with flat lying animation, you may not talk or
                interact with the scene.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may not return to the scene if you respawned at the hospital. You
                must wait for a minimum of 45 minutes from injury/respawn before
                remembering anything.
